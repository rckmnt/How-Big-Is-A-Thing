# How Big Is A Thing?

A general sizing API for a rough size of any object.


## Part 1. Ask how big a thing is.

TODO: This first part is a web interface where you can type in an object and it'll tell you its size.

    Example:
        In: "Sandwich"
        Out: "A Sandwich is about the size of a hand, a fist, a baseball ~ 150mm."


## Part 2. Contribute how big a new thing is.

TODO: This second part allows you to add a new object and its size (from 1 - 10) to the corpus.

    Example:
        In: Object >> "Chimichanga", Size >> "5"
